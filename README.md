## Project Description

### Pet Minder

This project is creating a hub (application) for pet owners and pet minders (might be a specific pet only such as dogs, e.g. Gowalkies). The application allows pet owners to find minders (and vice versa) based on ratings, testimonials, location and availability. The app should allow pet owners to give specific instructions to minders such as choosing walking routes, minding directions, etc. The app should enable minders to track their pets during walks or other activities.

## Module Description

Brief description of the module is available on the module descriptor [here](https://intranet.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/courses/descriptor/eecsismodule/mod/ECS506U).

## Learning Aims and Outcomes

The primary learning outcome in this module is that you will think about learning as a mindset and a process — it has no end point.

By the end of the module the student will be able to:

- **Acquire technical knowledge:** Understand the difference between programming in the small and software system construction; understand and use object oriented design techniques and software quality assurance methods; produce a range of documentation necessary for software systems; understand how to deliver systems incrementally.
- **Acquire practical & managerial knowledge:** Work in a team environment to produce a high quality software system within budget & time while dealing with complexity and change; understand the principles of risk management in software engineering and relevant ethical, professional and legal issues.
- **Acquire highly marketable skills:** Become proficient in UML — the most widely used method for object oriented system design (and a CASE tool to support it); be able to build real-world Java programs using a widely used programming environment.
